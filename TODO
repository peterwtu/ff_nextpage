** DONE BUG can't enable/disable <key>.
   this bug must be fixed.
   need to rewrite src/content/update-hotkeys.js

   maybe I should not use <key> at the first place. see how firemacs do it:
   chrome/firemacs.jar/content/keyhandler.js
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/files/browse/114031
   He is not using <key>!
** BUG <key>							    :wontfix:
    keyNode.setAttribute("disabled", true), keyNode.disabled = true neither works.
** BUG in XUL, keyset can't have an id like			    :wontfix:
   <keyset id="nextpage-keyset">
   otherwise, the whole group is disabled.

   I'm sure that id is not used by other elements.

   took me a long time to figure this out.

   actually there is no need to fetch the property. see the entry below.

* pages not working
** pages with frames
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/files/browse/66631
   when there is no scrollbar and no nextpage link.
   nextpage will 'eat' the SPC key. and do scroll page.
   while it should send SPC key event to element at mouse point?

   http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html
   frames, same problem as last item.
   the SPC should be passed to the element at point if failed to scroll?

   http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimpleDB/latest/DeveloperGuide/index.html?using.html
   SPC does nothing.
