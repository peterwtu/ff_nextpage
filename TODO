  uploaded on 2009-12-07, after upload you can put it in sandbox,
  then people can search and download your addon.
  after you have enough users, you can apply for a review, then make your
  addon public.
* DONE about l10n warning
  it's a bug of the checker. bad warning msg.

* integrate nextpage to firemacs, and keep the two versions going.
  both the independent and the one inside firemacs.
  of course I need to rewrite firemacs, esp the UI, before that.
* DONE use more strict next matching rule
  https://github.com/
  have a link like sylecn/ff_nextpage
  should not match it.
* DONE release to mozilla when all pages below are working.
* DONE use translatable strings in .js file
** TODO then submit addon to http://www.babelzilla.org/
* DONE change version number to 1.0 after test on my default profile
* check and report bug							:low:
  why keycode doesn't work in key tag.
  see overlay.xul for more info.
* make bindings configurable, also for firemacs.
* DONE remove all dump() calls in js file
* DONE add SPC keybinding in overlay.xul
* how to use the options defined in prefwindow.xul?
** DONE how to fetch that value in nextpage.js?
   ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Firefox_addons_developer_guide/Using_XPCOM%e2%80%94Implementing_advanced_processes
   actually there is no need to fetch the property. see the entry below.
** check/uncheck the option should trigger a function call to add
   binding/remove binding.
* DONE add menu item under View menu
  next page
* find/design an icon							:low:
  can be an open book with a 'n' on it
  the icon will be shown at addon menu. also on addon website.
* pages not working
** DONE SPC doesn't scroll up, directly turn to next page.
   (content.document.height <= content.pageYOffset + content.innerHeight)
   always true.
   content.document.height
   is wrong on these pages.

   this web page has serious markup error. when those are fixed,
   content.document.height will have the correct value.
   I can't help them on that, so this is not a bug of nextpage.
** can't go to next page
** go to the wrong page
