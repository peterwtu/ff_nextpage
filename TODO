** pages with frames
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/files/browse/66631
   when there is no scrollbar and no nextpage link.
   nextpage will 'eat' the SPC key. and do scroll page.
   while it should send SPC key event to element at mouse point?

   http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html
   frames, same problem as last item.
   the SPC should be passed to the element at point if failed to scroll?

** SPC jump to one spot, not scrolling
