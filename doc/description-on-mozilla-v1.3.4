When reading online documents or novels, I usually use SPC to scroll page. But SPC doesn't go to next page automatically. This addon rebinds SPC key so that it scroll page when there is more on the page, it go to next page when at the bottom of a page. You can also press n key anytime which will go to next page directly.

nextpage is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" title="free software ">free software</a> released under GPLv3. The source code is hosted at <a href="http://github.com/sylecn/ff_nextpage/" title="github">github</a>.

nextpage tries hard to not get in your way. If you find nextpage breaks your blog admin panel, some online registration form, or any kind of cool web application, please report a bug.

Currently English, Chinese and German web pages are supported. If you want to help to make nextpage work in pages written in your language, please submit a bug that contain a list of common words that means "next page" or a list of URLs that has "next page" links in your language.

Here is a list of keys that get rebinded:
SPC  scroll up/next page
n       next page
p       history back

A simple preference window is added to allows you to enable/disable keybindings.
You can also bind these keys in add-on preferences:
2       next page
1       history back
Alt-p  history back
Alt-n  next page

This add-on is only 28K zipped.
