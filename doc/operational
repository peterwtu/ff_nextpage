** 2012-08-23 read more about namespace problem.
   - Is it only a problem in browser.xul and its overlays?
   - Can I call another add-on's javascript code in my add-on?
     Can I include an exported js module?
     Could js module run in browser.xul context (overlay)?

   - read:
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/XUL_School/JavaScript_Object_Management
** 2012-08-22 separate syntax check and interpreter. maybe.
   all things should be moved to nextpage.js, the config.js should only do
   syntax check.

   - generating bindings objected. including clear via the unbind-all
     command.
   - enable-debug
** 2012-08-22 if user edit config file in external editor and there are errors,
   how to alert user?

   - well, for now, just let them check it in Preferences window.
** 2012-08-22 add lisp parser.
*** support more commands and configurable vars.
    ignoreBindingAList
    nextPattern
*** more complicated one, it's a hook.
    var preGeneric = [
    [/\/((thread|forum)-|(viewthread|forumdisplay)\.php)/i, this.getLinkForDiscuz],
    [/^http:\/\/osdir\.com\/ml\//i, this.getLinkForOsdirML],
    [/^http:\/\/coding\.derkeiler\.com\/Archive\//i, this.getLinkForDerkeilerML],
    [/\.wikisource\.org\//i, this.getLinkForWikiSource],
    [/^http:\/\/www\.baidu\.com\/s\?wd=/i, this.getLinkForBaiduSearch]
    ];

    Well, the ultimate is just built a lisp API and interpreter for the
    firefox add-on. If I can write the preGeneric functions in lisp, then I
    can almost do anything.
*** support functions, variables
    the config file will be much more powerful when user can define functions.
    I just export all built-in firefox function to be usable in lisp config
    file, then user can create anything they want.

    I would also like to implement closures, so user can have states.

** 2012-08-22 support show-downloads command.
** 2012-08-22 support undo-close-tab command.
** 2012-08-18 file io need to get more detailed error message.
   I can't find any document for the XPCOM return value's text representation.

   In all example code, 

       Components.isSuccessCode(status)

   is used to tell whether a async call is successful, but when it is not, how
   to get an error message?

   - update config.js when I know how to do this.
** 2012-07-20 create a universal key binding add-on for firefox. :complicated:
   Why:

   The freedom to add or modify key bindings should be given to the user.
   Ideally developers just write functions (user commands) and recommend a
   default key binding. Users should be able bind/unbind whichever function as
   they wish.

   Firefox is pretty bad at this.
   That's why there is Firemacs, Vimperator, vimkeybindings, many gesture based
   add-ons, all creating their own way of doing things. There is no portability
   and code reuse.

   This universal key binding add-on aims to solve this problem by creating a
   framework that all add-on developers can use. Users will be able to bind
   arbitrary keys to built-in and external functions.

*** 2012-07-20 pre-condition
    - Make sure one add-on can call functions defined in another add-on.
      Firefox add-on namespace problem.

*** 2012-07-20 structure
    This add-on:
    - read key binding configuration, and check commands exists in the system.
      later key bindings overwrite earlier.
    - create key bindings on the fly.
    - be able to get command declaration files.
    - be able to get recommended (default) key bindings for some add-on.
    - be able to get key binding profile that user can create and share.
    - user can store their config file on the cloud. (add-on provide this
      service for free.) or on their profile dir or even their home dir.

      For example, firefox provide different default keybindings on Windows,
      Linux and Mac, those three can be made into profile. User can get
      universal key bindings if they wish.

** 2012-08-22 add unbind command.				      :maybe:
   which works just like bind something to nil.
   a pair of key nil will be added in the bindings obj. semantics are the same
   as (bind key nil).
** 2012-08-22 really write a sexp parser in js
   currently to support nil, I make the quote char optional in bind_pattern
   regexp.
** 2012-08-22 use platform convention for config file path.	      :maybe:
   on linux: ~/.config/nextpage.lisp
   on windows: My Document/nextpage.lisp
   on Mac: ?
** 2012-08-22 implement key-chains					:low:
   so I can bind C-c ! h etc. this is for future use beyond nextpage.

* current							      :entry:
** 2012-08-22 if preferences window is already open, just switch to it.
   do not start a new preferences window.

   User could be confused if they edit code in one window, and hit save button
   in another.

   I guess could do this in init function.

*** update usage.html nextpage_show_preferences function. maybe.
    never show to preferences window to user.
** 2012-08-19 make nextpage a restart-less add-on.
   It should be easy given that my program is quite organized, overlay on GUI
   is quite minimum.

   requires firefox 4.

** 2012-08-22 when user upgrade to 1.3.6, read old preferences based config :rc:
   and create a default user config file is they are not using default
   settings in 1.3.4.

   - here is how it works:
     when nextpage read user config file, if it does not exist, and it found
     old preferences. create a user config file from old preferences.
     do not delete old preferences in case user wish to go back.
** 2012-08-19 grep for TODOs and 'log(' before commit
** 2012-08-26 translate the usage.html to Chinese
   en_US/usage.html
   zh_CN/usage.html
** 2012-08-22 update translation files
   clear old translation strings.
   "bind n/p" etc.

   - DONE remove old translation strings. added translation strings for
     preferences.xul GUI widgets.

   - in preferences.xul, some message printed also requires translation.

** 2012-08-26 clear up and release 1.3.6 which will be the last version that
   runs on [3.6, 4). after that I will make this add-on restart-less.

*** clear up
    - remove unused translations.
    - remove default preferences.
    - add Chinese usage.html page.
