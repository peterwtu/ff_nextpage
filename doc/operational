* 2012-07-20 create a universal key binding add-on for firefox. :complicated:
  Why:

  The freedom to add or modify key bindings should be given to the user.
  Ideally developers just write functions (user commands) and recommend a
  default key binding. Users should be able bind/unbind whichever function as
  they wish.

  Firefox is pretty bad at this.
  That's why there is Firemacs, Vimperator, vimkeybindings, many gesture based
  add-ons, all creating their own way of doing things. There is no portability
  and code reuse.

  This universal key binding add-on aims to solve this problem by creating a
  framework that all add-on developers can use. Users will be able to bind
  arbitrary keys to built-in and external functions.

** 2012-07-20 pre-condition
   - Make sure one add-on can call functions defined in another add-on.
     Firefox add-on namespace problem.

** 2012-07-20 structure
   This add-on:
   - read key binding configuration, and check commands exists in the system.
     later key bindings overwrite earlier.
   - create key bindings on the fly.
   - be able to get command declaration files.
   - be able to get recommended (default) key bindings for some add-on.
   - be able to get key binding profile that user can create and share.
   - user can store their config file on the cloud. (add-on provide this
     service for free.) or on their profile dir or even their home dir.

     For example, firefox provide different default keybindings on Windows,
     Linux and Mac, those three can be made into profile. User can get
     universal key bindings if they wish.
