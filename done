  <a href="act1-corruptrogue.shtml"
     onmouseout="offImg('next')"
     onmouseover="ovrImg('next')">
     <img
     src="file:///C:/My%20Web%20Sites/D2%20The%20Arreat%20Summit/classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/images/battle/diablo2exp/images/botmenu-next-off.gif"
     name="next" alt="Next" border="0" height="43" width="45">
