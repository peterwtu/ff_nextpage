** report a bug(with patch) to mailman, add rel="prev" "next" and access key

   edit: the <link rel='next' ...> in <head> works well.
* DONE nextpage doesn't work well when the focus is on a checkbox :bug:fixed:
  the default behavior should be check/uncheck the checkbox, but nextpage
  scroll the page down.
  fix: check whether a checkbox is focused. if it is, ignore SPC, do nothing.

  edit: now when document.activeElement is a <input> node, just return.
* DONE nextpage: detect google instant search.			    :wontfix:
  if instant search is on, press 'n' will input an 'n' in search box.

  I can't do anything with this. if the user decide to use google instant
  search, I should not take back 'n'.
* DONE get ready for firefox 4
  http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/11/11/making-add-on-compatible-firefox-4/
* DONE nextpage: add special case for the Arreat Summit			 :np:
  <a href="act1-corruptrogue.shtml"
     onmouseout="offImg('next')"
     onmouseover="ovrImg('next')">
     <img
     src="file:///C:/My%20Web%20Sites/D2%20The%20Arreat%20Summit/classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/images/battle/diablo2exp/images/botmenu-next-off.gif"
     name="next" alt="Next" border="0" height="43" width="45">
  </a>

  if a <a> has an <img> tag with alt or name lower case equals to "next"
  then it's a next page link.
